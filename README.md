Utilities for near-term applications of quantum computing in chemistry and materials science.

This repository currently contains a lightweight, template-derived QCANT package. The public API is small
and intended to grow as project modules are added.

## Install

QCANT requires scientific Python dependencies (installed automatically when you `pip install QCANT`):

- `numpy<2`, `scipy<2`
- `pennylane`
- `pyscf`
- `autoray<0.7`

For development (recommended: conda env for the full stack):

```bash
conda env create -f devtools/conda-envs/qcant.yaml
conda activate qcant
pip install -e . --no-deps
```

For development (pip/venv):

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Quickstart

```python
import QCANT

print(QCANT.canvas())
```

## Documentation

Hosted documentation:

- https://srivathsanps-quantum.github.io/QCANT/

The documentation lives in `docs/` and is built with Sphinx:

```bash
cd docs
make html
```

The output will be in `docs/_build/html`.
