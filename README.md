Utilities for near-term applications of quantum computing in chemistry and materials science.

This repository currently contains a lightweight, template-derived QCANT package. The public API is small
and intended to grow as project modules are added.

## Install

For development:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Quickstart

```python
import QCANT

print(QCANT.canvas())
```

## Documentation

The documentation lives in `docs/` and is built with Sphinx:

```bash
cd docs
make html
```

The output will be in `docs/_build/html`.
