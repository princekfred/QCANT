ADAPT-VQE
=========

QCANT provides an ADAPT-style VQE routine exposed as :func:`QCANT.aps_adapt`.

What it does
------------
The implementation in QCANT is an experimental/script-style implementation of an ADAPT loop:

- builds an electronic Hamiltonian for a small example system,
- iteratively selects an operator from a pool based on commutator magnitude,
- optimizes the ansatz parameters each iteration, and
- returns the optimized parameters, chosen excitations, and energies.

Dependencies
------------
This function requires optional, heavy scientific dependencies. QCANT is designed so that
``import QCANT`` works without them, but calling :func:`QCANT.aps_adapt` will raise
:class:`ImportError` unless they are installed.

Minimum expected dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install numpy scipy
   pip install pennylane
   pip install pyscf
   pip install basis_set_exchange

Depending on your PennyLane backend, you may also need:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install pennylane-lightning

Basic usage
-----------
.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np
   import QCANT

   symbols = ["H", "H", "H", "H"]
   geometry = np.array(
      [
         [0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
         [0.0, 0.0, 3.0],
         [0.0, 0.0, 6.0],
         [0.0, 0.0, 9.0],
      ]
   )

   params, excitations, energies = QCANT.aps_adapt(
      symbols=symbols,
      geometry=geometry,
      adapt_it=5,
      basis="sto-6g",
      charge=0,
      spin=0,
         active_electrons=4,
         active_orbitals=4,
   )

   print("Final energy:", energies[-1])
   print("Number of selected excitations:", len(excitations))

Outputs
-------
The function returns ``(params, ash_excitation, energies)``:

- ``params``: optimized parameter vector (final)
- ``ash_excitation``: list of excitations chosen over iterations
- ``energies``: list of energies after each iteration

Notes
-----
- The molecular geometry is user-provided via ``symbols`` and ``geometry``.
- Runtime and convergence depend strongly on the chosen backend/device and optimization settings.
- Treat this as research code; verify results and units for your specific use case.
